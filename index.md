## About Me

<!-- <img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg"> -->

I am a recent Physics PhD making a change of career into Machine Learning
and Artificial Intelligence. I have a strong quantitative background, with
specific expertise in high performance computing, numerical methods and data
analysis.

## Education:
* Ph.D. Physics (_University of Colorado, Boulder_, 2017):  "Perturbative and Ab-initio calculations of the electrical susceptibilities of atoms"
* M.S. Physics (_University of Colorado, Boulder_, 2013).
* B.S. Physics (_University of Washington_, 2010).

## Professional Experience:

### 2011 - 2017: Research Assistant in JILA at CU Boulder
* **Programming**: Developed a non-trivial code to solve the time dependent
  Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) in a field-free energy basis. The code was
  developed using PETSc and Boost MPI in C++14, with an approximate size of
  10kloc. https://github.com/spott/ebss
* **Data Analysis**: Data analysis package for the above TDSE solver output.
  Developed using pandas, numpy, scipy and matplotlib. Package available at
  https://github.com/spott/python\_da\_lib/

### 2015: Data Science Intern for Cognilytics at Centurylink
* **Data Science**: Preliminary analysis of anomalous network traffic for
  network security applications using raw packet captures with support vector
  machines, recurrent neural nets and random forests.
  
### 2010 - 2017: Teaching Assistant
* **Communication**: Taught a wide variety of introductory physics classes.
  Demonstrated a strong ability to take complex mathematical concepts and
  explain them intuitively.

## Skills

* Python Data analysis using NumPy, SciPy, pandas, matplotlib.
* Skilled in Python and C++14

## Relevant repositories

* [webpage-classifier](https://github.com/spott/webpage-classifier) - A project
  to classify webpages by topic. Uses reddit posts as a labeled dataset.
  Utilizes Docker, SQL, and async technologies in python. Latent Dirichlet
  Analysis via gensim is used to perform 
* [petsc-cpp](https://github.com/spott/petsc-cpp) - A C++ wrapper around the
  Sparse Linear Algebra Library PETSc.
* [ebss](https://github.com/spott/ebss) - A solver for the time dependent
  Schrodinger equation of an atom interacting with a strong laser field using
  the field-free energy basis. This is developed using PETSc and Boost MPI in
  C++14. It leverages MPI in order to efficiently run on large supercomputers.
* [da_lib](https://github.com/spott/python\_da\_lib/) - A set of tools for
  analysis of data from the above EBSS.
